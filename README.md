## Main Tools Used
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) - cloud platform, offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- [helm](https://helm.sh/) - Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) - a simple CLI tool for creating and managing clusters on EKS - Amazon's managed Kubernetes service for EC2.
- [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.
- [grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Grafana is the open source analytics & monitoring solution for every database.

## Demo
From the architecture flow shown;
Git --> GitHub --> eskctl --> helm --> kubernetes cluster --> prometheus --> Grafana

### Provision cluster with eskctl
- Creating cluster in the default region and without config file, run; ``eksctl create cluster``
#### Master node
